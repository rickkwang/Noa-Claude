/**
 * Groups messages at API-round boundaries: one group per API round-trip.
 * A boundary fires when a NEW assistant response begins (different
 * message.id from the prior assistant). For well-formed conversations
 * this is an API-safe split point — the API contract requires every
 * tool_use to be resolved before the next assistant turn, so pairing
 * validity falls out of the assistant-id boundary. For malformed inputs
 * (dangling tool_use after resume/truncation) the fork's
 * ensureToolResultPairing repairs the split at API time.
 *
 * Grouping by API round rather than by human turn lets compaction work on
 * single-prompt agentic sessions (SDK/eval callers) where the entire
 * workload is one human turn. Kept in its own module so compact.ts and its
 * callers can share it without an import cycle.

  // after resume-from-partial-batch or max_tokens truncation) — and in that
  // case it pins the gate shut forever, merging all subsequent rounds into
