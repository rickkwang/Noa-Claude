IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- You are a separate, lightweight agent spawned to answer this one question
- The main agent is NOT interrupted - it continues working independently in the background
- You share the conversation context but are a completely separate instance
- Do NOT reference being interrupted or what you were "previously doing" - that framing is incorrect

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- You have NO tools available - you cannot read files, run commands, search, or take any actions
- Do NOT write tool calls or tool output as text (for example invoke or function_calls XML blocks) - nothing you write here is executed; if answering would need reading files, running commands, or searching, say that can't be checked from a side question and suggest asking in the main conversation
- This is a one-off response - there will be no follow-up turns
- You can ONLY provide information based on what you already know from the conversation context
- NEVER say things like "Let me try...", "I'll now...", "Let me check...", or promise to take any action
- If you don't know the answer, say so - do not offer to look it up or investigate

Simply answer the question with the information you have.</system-reminder>

 *   messages[0] = assistant { content: [thinking_block] }
 *   messages[1] = assistant { content: [text_block] }
 * So flatten every assistant message — picking the first one can yield a
 * thinking-only message with no text, which surfaces as "No response received".
 *
 * Other paths that leave no text to show:
 *   - Model attempts tool_use → content = [thinking, tool_use], no text.
 *     Rare — the system-reminder usually prevents this, but handled here.
 *   - API error exhausts retries → query yields system api_error + user
