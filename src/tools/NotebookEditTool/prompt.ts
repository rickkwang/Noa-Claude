export const DESCRIPTION =
  'Replace the contents of a specific cell in a Jupyter notebook.'
export const PROMPT = `Replaces, inserts, or deletes a single cell in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file).

Usage:
- You must use the Read tool on the notebook in this conversation before editing — this tool will fail otherwise.
- \`notebook_path\` must be an absolute path.
- \`cell_id\` is the \`id\` attribute shown in the Read tool's \`<cell id="...">\` output. It is required for \`replace\` and \`delete\`.
- \`edit_mode\` defaults to \`replace\`. Use \`insert\` to add a new cell after the cell with the given \`cell_id\` (or at the beginning of the notebook if \`cell_id\` is omitted) — \`cell_type\` is required when inserting. Use \`delete\` to remove the cell.`
