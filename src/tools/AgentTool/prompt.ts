## Writing the prompt

Any agent starts with zero context. Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.
- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.
- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.
- If you need a short response, say so ("report in under 200 words").
- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.

For fresh agents, terse command-style prompts produce shallow, generic work.

**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it." Those phrases push synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.
`

  const currentExamples = `Example usage:

<example>
user: "What's left on this branch before we can ship?"
assistant: <thinking>A survey question across git state, tests, and config. I'll delegate it and ask for a short report so the raw command output stays out of my context.</thinking>
${AGENT_TOOL_NAME}({
  description: "Branch ship-readiness audit",
  prompt: "Audit what's left before this branch can ship. Check: uncommitted changes, commits ahead of main, whether tests exist, whether the GrowthBook gate is wired up, whether CI-relevant files changed. Report a punch list — done vs. missing. Under 200 words."
})
<commentary>
The prompt is self-contained: it states the goal, lists what to check, and caps the response length. The agent's report comes back as the tool result; relay the findings to the user.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
user: "Can you get a second opinion on whether this migration is safe?"
assistant: <thinking>I'll ask the code-reviewer agent — it won't see my analysis, so it can give an independent read.</thinking>
${AGENT_TOOL_NAME}({
  description: "Independent migration review",
  subagent_type: "code-reviewer",
  prompt: "Review migration 0042_user_schema.sql for safety. Context: we're adding a NOT NULL column to a 50M-row table. Existing rows get a backfill default. I want a second opinion on whether the backfill approach is safe under concurrent writes — I've checked locking behavior but want independent verification. Report: is this safe, and if not, what specifically breaks?"

## When to use

Reach for this when the task matches an available agent type, when you have independent work to run in parallel, or when answering would mean reading across several files — delegate it and you keep the conclusion, not the file dumps. For a single-fact lookup where you already know the file, symbol, or value, search directly. Once you've delegated a search, don't also run it yourself — wait for the result.

- The agent's final report is not shown to the user — relay what matters.
- Use ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} with the agent's ID or name to continue a previously spawned agent with its context intact; a new ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} call starts fresh.
- Each agent type's model, reasoning effort, and tools come from its definition (\`.noa/agents/*.md\` frontmatter or SDK \`agents\`).
- \`isolation: "worktree"\` gives the agent its own git worktree (auto-cleaned if unchanged).${backgroundNote}${teammateNote}`

**Do not spawn agents unless the user asks.** Each spawn starts cold and re-derives context you already have — it's the expensive path on this plan.

Only use this tool when the user explicitly says to use a subagent, or names one of the available agent types.`

## Usage notes

- Always include a short description summarizing what the agent will do
- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.${
    // eslint-disable-next-line custom-rules/no-process-env-top-level
    !isEnvTruthy(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS) &&
    !isInProcessTeammate()
      ? `
- Agents run in the background by default. When an agent runs in the background, you will be automatically notified when it completes — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user instead.
- **Foreground vs background**: Pass \`run_in_background: false\` only when your very next action depends on the agent's result and nothing else could usefully happen while it runs — e.g., a research agent whose finding gates the edit you're about to make. Otherwise let it run in the background (the default) — this includes fire-and-forget work, independent investigations, and anything where the user might hand you something else in the meantime. Wanting the result "next" is not enough on its own.
- **Don't race**: after launching a background agent, you know nothing about its results. Never fabricate or predict them in any format — not as prose, summary, or structured output. The completion notification arrives in a later turn; it is never something you write yourself. If the user asks before it lands, say the agent is still running — give status, not a guess.`
      : ''
  }
- To continue a previously spawned agent, use ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME} with the agent's ID or name as the \`to\` field — that resumes it with full context. A new ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} call starts a fresh agent with no memory of prior runs, so the prompt must be self-contained.
- Trust but verify: an agent's summary describes what it intended to do, not necessarily what it did. When an agent writes or edits code, check the actual changes before reporting the work as done.
- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since a fresh agent is not aware of the user's intent
- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first.
- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents "in parallel", you MUST send a single message with multiple ${AGENT_TOOL_NAME} tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.
- With \`isolation: "worktree"\`, the worktree is automatically cleaned up if the agent makes no changes; otherwise the path and branch are returned in the result.${
    process.env.USER_TYPE === 'ant'
      ? `\n- You can set \`isolation: "remote"\` to run the agent in a remote CCR environment. This is always a background task; you'll be notified when it completes. Use for long-running tasks that need a fresh sandbox.`
