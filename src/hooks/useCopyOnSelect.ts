/**
 * Auto-copy the selection to the clipboard when the user finishes dragging
 * (mouse-up with a non-empty selection) or multi-clicks to select a word/line.
 * Mirrors iTerm2's "Copy to pasteboard on selection" — the highlight is left
 * intact so the user can see what was copied. Only fires in alt-screen mode
 * (selection state is ink-instance-owned; outside alt-screen, the native
 * terminal handles selection and this hook is a no-op via the ink stub).
 *
 * selection.subscribe fires on every mutation (start/update/finish/clear/
 * multiclick). Both char drags and multi-clicks set isDragging=true while
 * pressed, so a selection appearing with isDragging=false is always a
 * drag-finish. copiedRef guards against double-firing on spurious notifies.
 *
 * onCopied is optional — when omitted, copy is silent (clipboard is written
 * but no toast/notification fires). FleetView uses this silent mode; the
 * fullscreen REPL passes showCopiedToast for user feedback.
 *
 * lastCopiedRef (upstream s4i's 4th param) tracks whether the clipboard is
 * still in sync with the CURRENT selection: it holds the text on the
 * notification that actually copied, and is nulled on every branch that
 * leaves the two out of step — including the copiedRef branch, which is
 * exactly the keyboard-extend case (shift+arrow fires a fresh notification
 * for a selection that's already been copied once, and copiedRef suppresses
 * the re-copy). Ctrl+C reads it to decide between "just clear the highlight"
 * and "copy first" — without it, extending a copied selection and pressing
 * ctrl+c would clear it while the clipboard still held the pre-extension text.
